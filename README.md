# The "I do it because it's fun" guy

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub — a place where curiosity wins, experiments multiply, and “why not?” is a perfectly valid design document.

> Fun first. Learning always. Polish… eventually.

## 🚀 How I work
- Get good idea
- Prototype fast
- Refactor later
- Rewrite from scratch and publish here if it works (even if partially)

## 🧩 Tech I enjoy
- Languages that make you think (C, Haskell, APL, Scheme, etc.)
- High customization (Linux, i3, etc.)
- Anything that rewards understanding over memorization

## 🧠 Warning
- Code written at all points of my learning experience (so porbably unoptimal)
- Code written for joy, not résumé points
- Hacked together solutions
